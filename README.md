# setgetscreenres

This is some code for querying/changing MacOS screen resolution that I
found in multiple versions around the web.  It seemed useful, and as
though it ought to be rescued, so I put it in a proper repository.
Feel free to fork it and change it as you wish.  I am not supporting
or maintaining this code, but if you find a compelling improvement, I
might be inclined to accept your pull request ;-)
